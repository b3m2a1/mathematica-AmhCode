#Status of ObjectOrientedProgramming package

Generally functional.

Improvements to be made:

Add documentation generating function for a class/instance. Add some docstring type thing.

Add option for light-weight class that has less support for different attribute types but 
which requires less upkeep. Save this as LightWeight.m

Potentially, allow for updating of methods of old classes and instances automatically when 
the class is edited. Write code to sync two classes and pass changes to instances. Rely on
the saved instance and class list.

Add better support for multiple iheritance a la python.

Consider making a new high-precedence, left-first overload operator. See if it is possible
to hack this in dynamically.
